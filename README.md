Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset — Transforming raw numbers into Survival stories
1. *Title:* Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>
Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python.  
This project uncovers *survival patterns* and provides *visual storytelling* with insights from class, gender, age, and family dynamics.

3. *Objective:* <br>
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the Titanic dataset. <br>
- Visualize patterns and survival distributions using Python libraries. <br>
- Identify key factors that influenced survival (class, gender, age, family size). <br>
- Build a foundation for predictive modeling.
  
3. *Key Insights:* <br>
- *Gender:* Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men. <br>
- *Class:* First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in third class. <br>
- *Age:* Children had better odds of survival than adults. <br>
- *Family Size:* Traveling alone or in very large groups reduced survival chances. <br>

4. *Tech Stack:* <br>
The analysis was conducted using the following tools and technologies: <br>
- *Python (3.8+)* — Core programming language. <br>
- *Pandas, NumPy* — Data manipulation and preprocessing. <br>
- *Matplotlib, Seaborn* — Visualizations for storytelling. <br>
- *Jupyter Notebook* — Interactive workflow for analysis. <br>
- *CSV dataset* — Input data file (titanic_train.csv). <br>

5. *Visualizations:* <br>
Generated charts included: <br>
- Survival Rates by Gender & Class <br>
- Age Distribution: Survivors vs Non-Survivors <br>
- Women & Children First Survival Patterns <br>
- Family Size vs Survival Probability <br>

6. *Dataset:* <br>
The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition.  
It contains passenger details such as age, sex, ticket class, family relations, and survival status.
